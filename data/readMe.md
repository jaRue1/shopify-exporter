# Data folder TLDR

Within this folder lives all the formatted data in the form of text file.There should be no preceding or trailing space at the beginning/end of the text file. There can be spaces between the delimiters.

Be sure that the name of the text file that you want to read is has the same name as its csv counterpart

example: batch1.txt -> batch1.csv && batch1.json

Format is as follows:

product tag;name;option value;price;option name
