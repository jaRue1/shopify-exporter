// all I need to do is mess with raw data

// ! Callouts

// * the handle name needs to be the same for variant products

// * there are some default value that need to be added for specific columns

// * we will need to manually add a type data point (painful I know)

// ref this video for other call outs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjxqacMnYlM
